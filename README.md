# Rogue Antivirus Cracking

This repo will contain my write-ups about cracking (mostly old) Fake Antiviruses.

Everything is done inside a VM or using my "malware box" (old Asus Brick running Windows XP), which are not connected to the internet or anything that can cause the infection to spread. This shouldn't happend anyways since there are well known malwares and should be stopped even with very weak Antiviruses.

I'll not waste too much time analyzing the whole infection method. I use these malwares as "dangerous" and more real life cases crackmes. The tools and methods I use here can be reproduce in CTF scenarios.

I'll say it just because I have too : Don't reverse engineer binaries that aren't made for this. It's illegal.

The malwares showcased here were made by malicious people that can't really do much about me reversing them. Do you think they are in position to sue me for this ?

I'll not give the samples, but they are easy to find if you want to do some reversing too. 

## What to do if you are infected with one of these

  - Use a real antivirus to remove the malware
  - If there is one and it's require to take back some control on your system, enter the key I found to register the fake av.
  - Backup what you can, and reinstall the OS.

The only viable way to fully remove a malware is to wipe the disk and do a fresh install. Even after activation, some malware will keep doing bad stuff in the background and THEY ARE NOT GIVING YOU ANY PROTECTION.

## Repository contributions

I guess that my english isn't perfect everytime and that maybe some will want to correct some of my mistake and I'm completely fine with it.

If you find newer samples you can make an issue and I'll see if I can do something with it.
