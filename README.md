# Rogue Antivirus Cracking

This repo will contain my write-ups about cracking (mostly old) Fake Antiviruses.

Everything is done inside a VM or using my "malware box" (old Asus Brick running Windows XP), which are not connected to the internet or anything that can cause the infection to spread. This shouldn't happend anyways since there are well known malwares and should be stopped even with very weak Antiviruses.

I'll not waste too much time analyzing the whole infection method. I use these malwares as "dangerous" and more real life cases crackmes. The tools and methods I use here can be reproduce in CTF scenarios.

I'll say it just because I have too : Don't reverse engineer binaries that aren't made for this. It's illegal.

The malwares showcased here were made by malicious people that can't really do much about me reversing them. Do you think they are in position to sue me for this ?

I'll not give the samples, but they are easy to find if you want to do some reversing too.
